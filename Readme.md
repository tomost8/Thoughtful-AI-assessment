# Package Sorting Function

This repository contains a function that sorts packages based on their volume and mass for a robotic automation system. The function determines whether a package is classified as **STANDARD**, **SPECIAL**, or **REJECTED**.

## Problem Overview

The function must sort packages using the following criteria:

- A package is **bulky** if its volume (Width x Height x Length) is greater than or equal to 1,000,000 cmÂ³ or if any of its dimensions is greater than or equal to 150 cm.
- A package is **heavy** if its mass is greater than or equal to 20 kg.

Packages are sorted into the following categories:
- **STANDARD**: Packages that are neither bulky nor heavy.
- **SPECIAL**: Packages that are either bulky or heavy.
- **REJECTED**: Packages that are both bulky and heavy.

## Function

```python
def sort(width, height, length, mass):
    volume = width * height * length
    is_bulky = volume >= 1_000_000 or width >= 150 or height >= 150 or length >= 150
    is_heavy = mass >= 20

    if is_bulky and is_heavy:
        return "REJECTED"
    elif is_bulky or is_heavy:
        return "SPECIAL"
    else:
        return "STANDARD"
```

## How to Use

### Input

The function `sort(width, height, length, mass)` accepts the following parameters:
- `width`: The width of the package in centimeters.
- `height`: The height of the package in centimeters.
- `length`: The length of the package in centimeters.
- `mass`: The mass of the package in kilograms.

### Output

The function returns a string indicating the category of the package:
- **"STANDARD"**: The package is neither bulky nor heavy.
- **"SPECIAL"**: The package is either bulky or heavy.
- **"REJECTED"**: The package is both bulky and heavy.

### Example Usage

```python
# Example 1: A standard package
sort(100, 100, 100, 10)
# Output: "STANDARD"

# Example 2: A bulky and heavy package (rejected)
sort(200, 100, 100, 30)
# Output: "REJECTED"

# Example 3: A heavy but not bulky package
sort(100, 100, 100, 25)
# Output: "SPECIAL"

# Example 4: A bulky but not heavy package
sort(160, 100, 100, 15)
# Output: "SPECIAL"
```

## Test Cases

The following test cases demonstrate how the function handles different scenarios:

| Width | Height | Length | Mass | Expected Output |
|-------|--------|--------|------|-----------------|
| 100   | 100    | 100    | 10   | STANDARD        |
| 200   | 100    | 100    | 30   | REJECTED        |
| 100   | 100    | 100    | 25   | REJECTED        |
| 160   | 100    | 100    | 15   | SPECIAL         |
